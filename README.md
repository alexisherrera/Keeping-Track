# Keeping-Track
Java GUI that I developed for New Challenge Day Centers that kept track of time, ratios of staff to kids, and status of children and staff in the system.

## Getting Started

To get this running locally I recomend downloading the entire repo and saving it into a folder. Once saved compile the NewChallengeProgram.java file and run the NewChallengeProgram.class file through the command line. If you have an IDE like Eclipse you could simply run the NewChallengeProgram.java file.

### Clone repo

If you have git set up on your machine simply type the following line into your command line:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/alexisherrera/Keeping-Track
```

## Built With

* Java, Swing
